# Autonomous Vehicle Navigation System in Carla

## Overview
This comprehensive repository is dedicated to the simulation and execution of an autonomous vehicle navigation system utilizing the robust Carla simulator framework. Encompassing a series of Python scripts, this system intricately plans routes, manages vehicle dynamics for speed and steering, and flawlessly executes autonomous driving within the complex simulation environment provided by Carla.

## System Requirements
To effectively run this simulation, the following components are necessary:
- **Python 3.8.0:** The core programming language used for all scripting and automation.
- **Carla Simulator (0.9.14):** A cutting-edge open-source simulator for autonomous driving research.
- **NumPy:** A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- **NetworkX:** A Python library for the creation, manipulation, and study of the complex networks of roads.
- **Carla Python API:** Essential for interfacing with the Carla Simulator, allowing for the control and manipulation of both vehicles and environments within the simulator.

## Detailed Module Descriptions

### Global Route Planner (`global_route_planner.py`)
A sophisticated module designed to chart a high-level course through any given environment, employing advanced algorithms to navigate the complexities of road networks.

### Lateral Controller (`lateral_controller.py`)
This script is key to managing the vehicle's steering, utilizing the Pure Pursuit algorithm to maintain the intended path with precision.

### Longitudinal Controller (`longitudinal_controller.py`)
Essential for controlling the vehicle's speed, this module implements a PID controller to adjust velocity in response to environmental conditions and maintain optimal driving behavior.

### Utilities (`utils.py`)
A collection of auxiliary functions that support various tasks such as distance calculations, speed assessments, and vector management, crucial for the smooth operation of the navigation system.

### Main Execution Script (`main.py`)
The heart of the simulation, this script ties all modules together, coordinating the vehicle's spawning, route planning, and real-time control to execute autonomous navigation within the Carla environment.

## Simulation Execution Guide
To initiate the autonomous vehicle simulation:
1. Ensure all prerequisites are installed and properly configured, particularly the Carla Simulator.
2. Execute the `main.py` script. This will launch the simulation, with the vehicle autonomously navigating through the designated environment according to the preplanned route and responding dynamically to obstacles and road conditions.

## Underlying Mechanics
The system employs a meticulously planned route generated by the Global Route Planner, leveraging real-time data to control the vehicle's movements accurately. The lateral and longitudinal controllers work in harmony to adjust steering and speed, ensuring the vehicle adheres to its intended path while responding to the dynamic simulation environment.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a testament to the potential of combining sophisticated route planning and control algorithms within a simulated environment to achieve realistic autonomous vehicle navigation. It lays a foundation for further exploration and development in the field of autonomous driving research.
